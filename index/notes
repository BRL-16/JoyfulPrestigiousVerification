<!-- You will present the 6 aspects of your wellness in a creative way that helps express how you navigate each of these wellness areas. Think back to the multiple intelligences quiz you completed earlier, reflecting on your physical healthy and wellness, etc. 


This can be done by creating a poster or slideshow, you could even curate a 'Wellness Playlist' that could highlight each of these aspects
explaining how and why these songs fit with each of your aspects of wellness. 
For each aspect, you must briefly explain how it exists in your life!
Physical (how do you stay active and live a healthy lifestyle)
Emotional (how do you manage stress and resiliency)
Spiritual (what helps you find purpose and meaning?
hobbies, interests, etc)
Social (what social circles are meaningful to you, what ways to you stay connected and social with others?)
Intellectual (what multiple intelligences do you possess? what interests do you like to explore in your own free time? -->
