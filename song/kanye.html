                    Michael Jackson's album called Bad features a song called Man in the Mirror, which connects to 
                    my Social well-being. Kanye's song; I wonder,  conveys the importance of individual reflection
                    and the idea of personal growth. The frequent reference to the idea of making a world a better place
                    can be tied to our personal growth with the lyrics of: "If you wanna make a world a better place than 
                    take a look at yourself and make a change." Although I want to become better, I am not sure if I am the 
                    right person to make the world better place. However, I am willing to become a better person and show 
                    empathy towards others and compassion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it make an impact in my Social well-being?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The song, Man in the mirror by Michael Jackson has made slight impact in my life as it allowed me to
                    also take into consideration of others instead of myself, which I was kinda selfish before I started High School
                    and slightly cared about myself. However, this song slightly improved my worldview of being more compassionate and 
                    being more nicer.
