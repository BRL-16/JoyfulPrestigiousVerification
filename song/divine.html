                <p class="paragraph-1"> 
                    Kanye West's album of Graduation features a song called I wonder, which connects to 
                    my emotional well-being. Kanye's song; I wonder,  conveys the emotion of resiliency and the 
                    idea to achieve our dreams; and how our resiliency plays a major part to our dreams.
                    Overall, Kanye fits into my emotional well-being, as it continues to remind me to 
                    be more resillient and focus on my dream that continues to galvanize myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it make an impact in my Emotional well-being?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The song, I wonder allows me to keep going if I have a bad day due to inadequate marks or 
                    self-doubt of my skills and comparing myself to others such as brilliant students everywhere
                    and allows to remind myself that I can achieve my dreams if I am resillient and focus 
                    on my dreams. I wonder's lyrical meaning resonates within me as the song I wonder has conveyed
                    resillient and highlighting its importance. Kanye's frequent chorus of "And I wonder if you know
                    What it means, To find your dreams" stresses the idea of Kanye's ambitio and the struggle he faces.
