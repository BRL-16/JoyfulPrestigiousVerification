                <p class="paragraph-1"> 
                    Journey's song: Don't Stop Believin', has been the main inspiration for my 
                    Spiritual  well-being. Journey's lyrical genius continues to catalyze for my sense of purpose
                    and the idea of resilliency that also connects toward my Emotional well-being. The song 
                    introduces a small-town girl and a city boy searching the sense of purpose in their life. I am
                    able to relate to the search of purpose in my life, as I am almost an adult and going to College, which
                    can be overwhealming. The mention of "boarding a mid-night train," is about the two people travelling in their new life.
                    I feel like I can almost relate to this. As the boarding the mid-night train for me can be compared to almost preparing
                    for College and leaving Bassano and achieving my dream. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it make an impact in my Spiritual well-being?
                </h2>
                <p>
                   The song has inspired me to achieve my dreams and work on it. I feel like I am woring towards the idea of improving my 
                   other activites such as Badminton, Basketball, Track and Field, and Programming. I  wanna become a IOI gold medalist by next year, and the competiton is rough. However, if I dedicate my time with practices and mastering the concepts. I can achieve it, and the idea of track and field and becoming successful towards the sport that I mention will resonate with my head.
